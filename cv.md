# About me
I first studied web development as a hobby. After a while it became more than a hobby.
I enjoy learning and doing web development. I am happy to help new developers.
To do this, there is a chat in the telegram where newcomers gathered and we help each other.
I listen to web-standards and frontend-weekend podcasts regularly and sometimes visit meetups.
I want to improve my knowledge and learn React.
